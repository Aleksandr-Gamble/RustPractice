CC-linker
#Rust uses the CC linker, so on a new machine you need to run
sudo apt install build-essential

VSCode extensions
# use the Rust rls extension, not the nightly build one
# note! use File-> Add Folder to Workspace to get the functionality

Semantic Versioning
# When you include crates in your Cargo.toml file, cargo will look for versions compatable with that API.
# It will also pull their dependencies. The Cargo.lock file shows the actual version used for each.
# This ensures a reproducable build.

READ THE DOCS
# run cargo doc --open to create and view a webpage with documentation
# just your dependencies will be shown
