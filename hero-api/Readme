ISSUES

* use this starting tempalte instead of the once provided. The old one did not complie due to this error:

#![feature(proc_macro_hygiene, decl_macro)]
#[macro_use] extern crate rocket;
#[get("/<name>/<age>")]
fn hello(name: String, age: u8) -> String {
    format!("Hello, {} year old named {}!", age, name)
}
fn main() {
        rocket::ignite()
            .mount("/hello", routes![hello])
            .launch();
}
